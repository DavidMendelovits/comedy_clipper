So we should win. That's right. Any more further issues with the time you know. If you're in the last group this week, we know that's not so funny. Even though this is a light one, come on back next week. We'll get you a fairly... If you are in the last week, you have a lot of me know already. My colleague, let

First we got a little bit of host comedy for you. Makes a most of your first community and everybody's in Streplein.

[02:05] [Speaker 3]
Hey. I need constraints. Hey. I don't think

[02:11] [Speaker 2]
it's going to be here. I have a probably a married man. I don't want to work out.

[03:45] [Speaker 3]
I don't want to work out. I have to know. She recently, you know, I don't know. I use um. I use just for men. Hair shampoo. Do we know this? We know this? And my wife used by shampoo. She exploded. Oh, my gosh. It's not for men. Oh, my. My wife is unexploded. She's cool. I like her. We had a great wedding. We did Cornell's marriage. I had a great good Cornell's marriage. 90 seconds in and out. Our dad's worth thrilled. I love thinking good time. But that was great. The woman who married her was a. Four feet tall. She was. It was mostly podium. I'm going to get. We have. We have mostly we got podium. Mary does. And she was talking real fast because she's a pro. She's 90 seconds in and out. But I. Being done looked at her because she was talking real fast. And then she yelled from the podium. Don't give me. Look at her. She got scolded. It's good. It's good. And then. And then I would. I've never seen this. She was a pro but she loved love because she didn't go. And you can now see the marriage with a kiss. And a hug. Come on. The kiss is real chase because I'm panic. And when right for the hug. It's not. It's not. But it's not. I've been married. Getting married was interesting. I noticed like a wedding. Advertisements are really different. And then women like. Women. I was like this. This will be your special day. This will be your special day. But then like wedding ring advertisements for men are like, Yeah, you're going to get married to a

[03:50] [Speaker 2]
lady. But you can't look gay. Do it. Here's the manly ring. This one's made from.

[04:16] [Speaker 3]
It's made from oak from a whiskey barrel and metal from a sword. And I didn't get that wedding ring. What's it my mind? And it is. If I wife and I we are both bisexual. But we made each other. But we bought them Joe. What? Joseph. She's Josephine. We're about there for the same. Biblical cook.

[04:20] [Speaker 2]
But it is funny. There's people ask us done things. So we have the same name.

[05:00] [Speaker 3]
They'll be like, hey, do you ever get each other confused for each other? Nope. We know that we know which subjective reality is our own. No, it's just cool. No, I can't. I know like my way. Sometimes people will ask me if she took my last name. And it's like, what do you think of me? I married two Joe Pomonsons. I was in the same. And it's something every time people ask. I do unrelated. I work with kids with autism. I don't know if the kids are working with. They've been recently tried to figure out jokes, which has been really fun. The big joke right now. They're all teenagers. So it's just, hey, you farted.

[05:05] [Speaker 2]
Pretty certain. Good every time. But they did get a little bit after a year. So maybe you could

[05:40] [Speaker 3]
try to mix it up with the kid with. I'm going to mix it up. Hey, Joe, you pooped in your pants. Hard. Excellent word of God. That's good. And then he just, he's like, can we joke? And then he just lies. It's pretty good, but it is confusing. And because like, is like, can we joke? Okay, because we were on a flight. And I was the pilot. Okay. I'll look at you. But then I told them, like, hey, I think this is mostly just lying. And he went, okay. Then my goats had to go to the bathroom. So I took him. And then I don't know what he was thinking about

[06:05] [Speaker 2]
the whole time. But he came out of the bathroom. So, Joe, do you know Judge Judy? Oh my god. I want to go. Yeah, I don't judge Judy because very, very white teenager without this of goes. Because you know like no fives. That's good. I know she does that. You know what he's like. You got me. That was a good joke. Hey, why don't we get things over for a goat.

[08:50] [Speaker 1]
Okay, so good. Fuck yeah. Fuck, man. Yeah. Yeah. I don't feel more. We are going to be. All right. I, uh, when I was little, my mom came to my preschool school to teach the, it's my preschool about Islam. She was raised most like she doesn't just do that. But an interesting thing was that she wore a hijab for a presentation, which was kind of weird because she doesn't do that. Like, like, like, like I understand that she was like teaching the kids of a very common Muslim garment, but that's a crazy thing to see a parent where once you don't know what I mean. You guys don't know my mom. This bitch loves cured ham. All right. This is stark shift in the story. I am a student of history. Fun fact, did you know that George Washington couldn't tell the lie because his wouldn't teeth would get longer? No, but this is absolutely true. Did you know that the Wizard of Oz was filmed over the course of the beginning of World War II. It was shot at the exact same time. There was actually a cast member in the shoot who was actually an out and proud Nazi. The dog that played Toto. You were right. It was. It was that dog. We don't know actually what the dogs political opinions were. But I do know for a fact that this was at a time when dogs didn't have to be so vocally pro-Jew in order to get ahead and Hollywood. Pretty fucking cool. No, like I said, I come from a Muslim family. I was talking to my own goal recently. And we were talking about movies. He said, look, did you know that Godzilla had a Muslim cousin? And I was like, hey man, no, that didn't have it. Not at all. And it was like, no, he absolutely did. He made the hodge, the pilgrimage to the Holy Land. And I was like, no, there's absolutely no Godzilla that is Muslim that made the pilgrimage. And he was like, so why is he called mechagonzilla? All right. I feel like I feel a kind shift to pregnant women because pregnant women per universally get unsolicited advice about how to deal with pregnancy and birth and everything. And I feel a little bit of a kind shift because that's my relationship to fitness advice. Guys, look at me and they're like, oh, this is a project right here. This is someone we can make good. I will leave with this. I have a friend who she's from China. And I asked her recently, oh, where a Chinese did you grow up? And she said, in her Mongolia. And I was like, cool, follow up question. Am I having a stroke right now? What is this? She's like, no, in her Mongolia

[09:06] [Speaker 2]
is just the name of a region that's in China. Like a border's Mongolia. It's in the north. It's right there. But it's completely contained with a China. Like you could write it as in her Mongolia, Kala China. Which is really cool. Because I had no idea that China had its own Kansas city Missouri. Like that.

[09:10] [Speaker 3]
All right, thanks.

[09:22] [Speaker 1]
Thank you. Please look at the guys. Keep it up here, guys. Keep it up here, guys. All right.

[09:25] [Speaker 3]
Oh, wait, okay. So it's just a joke, but it just happened a couple

[09:40] [Speaker 1]
days ago. I was walking by the McDonald's. I thought it'd be fine. Like a guy walked by. He's not going to McDonald's anyway. Ah, yeah, McDonald's. I didn't want to. That's just a funny thing. The excitement. I'm actually found out about the

[09:46] [Speaker 3]
restaurants. You were just so happy.

[09:50] [Speaker 1]
And I just got on the train with a big smile. Anyway, I

[09:55] [Speaker 3]
just got back from spending videos with my parents. My mom was a sort of podcast

[10:00] [Speaker 1]
with me. I liked home. And she got mad. She was like, why didn't I tell her

[10:05] [Speaker 2]
because you don't like my jokes. She does it. I told one joke. I

[10:20] [Speaker 3]
was like, what about this one? And then the joke was, um, I wanted to say both so the joke is, um, So I'm not even enough. You're disabled. Because it's very broad spectrum. You know, if you're just my, my spectrum for the night, you're disabled is if the school janitor gave you high five for

[10:25] [Speaker 2]
no reason. That's how you know, that's

[10:30] [Speaker 3]
how you know, whether you're not, whether you're disabled. And then she went, oh, I hate that

[10:50] [Speaker 1]
joke. Okay. I was like, why? And then she went on this tire to, like, first of all, you, that implies that I didn't tell you that you would be saved. What a crazy spend. And she said, also if you tell people that you're disabled, they will take advantage of you. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, talk

[11:05] [Speaker 3]
about it and say, you just makes me, what is a, people going to ask me for money? Like, I don't understand what she means. And then, oh, you know, that's the thing. I got home. And I'm very insecure, maybe that inside of my mom, but she was why, but I only

[11:15] [Speaker 1]
were like black pants usually. I was wearing these pants and I'm very insecure for whatever. These are normal pants, right? They're fine. But I think I'm going to get like a trouble. If I go outside

[11:25] [Speaker 3]
with a passion choice. And then I walked into my parents house and my mom went, oh, that's a choice. Looking at these pants. And then my whole family debated about my pants. And

[11:30] [Speaker 1]
then my aunt said, wait, Neil, you're by, right?

[11:50] [Speaker 2]
I said, no, I should be in. And then that was the end of that. Yeah. Was there anything else that happened at home? Mom was to her podcast. Would you guys do that? No, not a single yes. Wait, you said yes? That should be your sweet, do you? Did you say yes? Oh, okay. I'm going to guess, I do.

[11:55] [Speaker 1]
Okay, but look after that podcast and tell yours. Thanks guys, bye. Woo! Thank

[12:02] [Speaker 2]
you so much for being here.

[12:05] [Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So,

[12:10] [Speaker 2]
uh, my dad forged my signature on it. $200,000

[12:25] [Speaker 1]
business loan. Whoa. Okay, I look a little to know. I can get improved for business loan. Okay, okay. Hit it, use nice, pretty, use nice. What's with all boys

[12:32] [Speaker 2]
to his private school growing up? Is that the vibe?

[13:15] [Speaker 1]
Two private schools very interesting because we had a very thorough holocaust education. That's right. The second get more sad. And every year they would bring in holocaust survivors and they would say, hey, they're less and less holocaust survivors a lot and soon they're going to be not. So you are going to have to tell everyone about the holocaust. So, I guess, have just been to be a perpetual buzzkill. Just try and insert it to every conversation I can. Oh, you sent him hints to camp, that's nice. Yeah, I don't know. Every time I start this bit on my couch,

[13:20] [Speaker 2]
you do I go, I have to do I do this whole.

[13:25] [Speaker 1]
Oh, but it was an off-boys Jewish private school and we didn't have sex. Because

[13:30] [Speaker 2]
all the classes were copyrighted by this and if we had sex, that means the rat bodies would teach

[13:40] [Speaker 1]
you. And I already know how to push two beds together without giving the kids up. So I learned sex ad from this book called

[14:00] [Speaker 2]
Sex for Dummies. You guys feel seen? I think my title should actually be sex for smart people because we need the help more. Yeah, actually, I have a lot of folks about sex. It's why I learned how to read. Kind of like reading a fan fiction
